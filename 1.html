<h2>HMTL</h2>
<h3>HTML 이란 무엇인가?</h3>
<img src="coding.jpg" width="80%">
<p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-html5-20110405/" target="_blank" title="html5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language</a> (HTML) is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications.</p>
<h2>Tags</h2>
<p>The bits of text which can be found inside of the angle brackets along with the brackets are known as 'Tags'. This is used to separate code from normal text. They also help to tell the browser how to display the web page between the opening and closing tags. These two;  <html> and </html>. All tags come in pairs, as one tag is used to open the tag and the other used to close the tag, the difference shown in the HTML tags above. Finally, you must always remember to open and close the tags and remember to use the angle brackets for them to work. </p>

<h2>Elements</h2>

<p>Elements are the tag as a whole, so this includes the opening tag, the text within and then the closing tag as well. Following on, a web page is lots of HTML Elements all put together like a giant puzzle. Elements are very easy to understand once you understand Tags. The only part of elements where it can start to become tricky is when you have elements appearing within elements, however, if you practice this section a lot you will then realise it's not tricky if you know where to put the element codes.</p>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Attributes are used to define the more specific information within an element. They usually come in name, value pairs, (name=“value”). Attributes can also be used to help size images, change the font, size and colour of the text. This means most types of elements will only appear/ be used if we need them to. The main two points you will need to remember about Attributes is to put quotation marks around the value so it can be identified more easily. Secondly, write it out in all lower case.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>In conclusion, if you would like to know more about HTML and be shown how to create HTML, keep your eyes peeled this autumn as a new course will be coming to SchudioTV.
This course will show you how to create certain features such as text, images and lists through HTML. This can then implement onto your Schools website to take it to the next level.</p>
